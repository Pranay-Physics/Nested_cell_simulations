<h1> Nested herriott cell concentric ring simulation GUI </h1>

This project is to simulate the formation of a spot pattern in a nested herriot cell. 
For this simulation I have chosen 3 physical parameters that we can control, Radius of cuvature of outer mirror R1, Radius of curvature of inner mirror R2, and the coaxial mirror seperation d.

For use of this program, just run the nested_cell_slider program, it contains all of the functions and GUI code. You may change the range of values each of the parameters can take and the resolution by which they
change in the slider by adjusting the values in the self.{parameter}_slider  lines in the init function of the class.
